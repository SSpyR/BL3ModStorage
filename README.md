# SSpyR's Borderlands 3 Mod Storage
Personal GitHub repo for storage of Hotfix mods for Borderlands 3. All of my mods can be found in the sspyrmods folder (spymodlist.txt is my mods list to load active mods, some of apocalyptech's mods are listed here for me to load and are labeled as his)

Along with my mods I also store apocalyptech's mods here for some reference while I still get used to making these, that folder is labeled appriorately.

Coding Structure to gen mods was also kindly provided by apocalyptech, everything I have referenced from him can be found in his repo here: https://github.com/apocalyptech/bl3hotfixmodding

Note: Probably my most ambitious mod to date, that being my Runtime Randomizer mod, currently cannot be normally stored on Github due to its size. I will work out a way to regularly upload/update it there but in the meantime you can download the repo and build the text file on your machine and it should work just fine.
