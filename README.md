# SSpyR's Borderlands 3 Mod Storage
Personal GitHub repo for storage of Hotfix mods for Borderlands 3. All of my mods can be found in the sspyrmods folder (the mod_gear mod is provided from apocalyptech)

Along with my mods I also store apocalyptech's mods here for some reference while I still get used to making these, that folder is labeled appriorately.

Coding Structure to gen mods was also kindly provided by apocalyptech, everything I have referenced from him can be found in his repo here: https://github.com/apocalyptech/bl3hotfixmodding
